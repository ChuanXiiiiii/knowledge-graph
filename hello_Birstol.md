# Hello Bristol ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains the source code for the **Knowledge Graph Construction** project, which I developed as part of my research on **large model unlearning evaluation**. The work directly supports the experiments and methodologies described in our paper:

> **Lei Ziyan**, et al. *The Twin Pillars of LLM Unlearning Audit: Ensuring Adequacy and Nonâ€‘Redundancy through Knowledge Graphs*. arXiv preprint, 2025.  
> [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18810)

## Purpose of This Project
The code in this repository is designed to:
- Process large-scale text corpora (Harry Potter series)  
- Construct structured knowledge graphs  
- Support quantitative evaluation of unlearning effects in large language models

## My Contribution
I am the sole author and maintainer of this repository.  
All scripts, algorithms, and data processing pipelines were implemented by me in **Python**.  
The code here was used in the experiments reported in the above paper.
