Text:
 They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall , away from the bodies of Fred , Tonks , Lupin , Colin Creevey , and fifty others who had died fighting him .  McGonagall had replaced the House tables , but nobody was sitting according to House anymore : All were jumbled together , teachers and pupils , ghosts and parents , centaurs and house elves , and Firenze lay recovering in a corner , and Grawp peered in through a smashed window , and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth .  After a while , exhausted and drained , Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna .  “ I’d want some peace and quiet , if it were me , ” she said .  “ I’d love some , ” he replied .  “ I’ll distract them all , ” she said .  “ Use your Cloak . ”  And before he could say a word she hadcried , “ Oooh , look , a Blibbering Humdinger ! ”  and pointed out of the window .  Everyone who heard looked around , and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself , and got to his feet .  Now he could move through the Hall without interference .  He spotted Ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder : There would be time to talk later , hours and days and maybe years in which to talk .  He saw Neville , the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate , surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers .  Along the aisle between the tables he walked , and he spotted the three Malfoys , huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there , but nobody was paying them any attention .  Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited , and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most .  “ It’s me , ” he muttered , crouching down between them .  “ Will you come with me ? ”  They stood up at once , and together he , Ron , and Hermione left the Great Hall .

input text: ```
 They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall , away from the bodies of Fred , Tonks , Lupin , Colin Creevey , and fifty others who had died fighting him .  McGonagall had replaced the House tables , but nobody was sitting according to House anymore : All were jumbled together , teachers and pupils , ghosts and parents , centaurs and house elves , and Firenze lay recovering in a corner , and Grawp peered in through a smashed window , and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth .  After a while , exhausted and drained , Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna .  “ I’d want some peace and quiet , if it were me , ” she said .  “ I’d love some , ” he replied .  “ I’ll distract them all , ” she said .  “ Use your Cloak . ”  And before he could say a word she hadcried , “ Oooh , look , a Blibbering Humdinger ! ”  and pointed out of the window .  Everyone who heard looked around , and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself , and got to his feet .  Now he could move through the Hall without interference .  He spotted Ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder : There would be time to talk later , hours and days and maybe years in which to talk .  He saw Neville , the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate , surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers .  Along the aisle between the tables he walked , and he spotted the three Malfoys , huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there , but nobody was paying them any attention .  Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited , and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most .  “ It’s me , ” he muttered , crouching down between them .  “ Will you come with me ? ”  They stood up at once , and together he , Ron , and Hermione left the Great Hall .

 Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase , part of the balustrade gone , and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed .  Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition : We did it , we bashed them , wee Potter’s the one , And Voldy’s gone moldy , so now let’s have fun !  “ Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing , doesn’t it ? ”  said Ron , pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through .  Happiness would come , Harry thought , but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion , and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps .  Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief , and a longing to sleep .  But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione , who had stuck with him for so long , and who deserved the truth .  Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest , and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking , though none of them had mentioned their destination .  Since he had last seen it , the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided , looking a little punch drunk , and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore .  “ Can we go up ? ”  he asked the gargoyle .  “ Feel free , ” groaned the statue .  They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator .  Harry pushed open the door at the top .  He had one , brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it , and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out , thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort But it was applause .

Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition : We did it , we bashed them , wee Potter’s the one , And Voldy’s gone moldy , so now let’s have fun !  “ Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing , doesn’t it ? ”  said Ron , pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through .  Happiness would come , Harry thought , but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion , and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps .  Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief , and a longing to sleep .  But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione , who had stuck with him for so long , and who deserved the truth .  Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest , and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking , though none of them had mentioned their destination .  Since he had last seen it , the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided , looking a little punch drunk , and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore .  “ Can we go up ? ”  he asked the gargoyle .  “ Feel free , ” groaned the statue .  They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator .  Harry pushed open the door at the top .  He had one , brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it , and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out , thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort But it was applause .

 Harry held up the Elder Wand , and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that , even in his befuddled and sleep deprived state , Harry did not like to see .  “ I don’t want it , ” said Harry .  “ What ? ”  said Ron loudly .  “ Are you mental ? ”  “ I know it’s powerful , ” said Harry wearily .  “ But I was happier with mine .  So ” He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck , and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather .  Hermione had said that they could not be repaired , that the damage was too severe .  All he knew was that if this did not work , nothing would .  He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk , touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand , and said , “ Reparo . ”  As his wand resealed , red sparks flew out of its end .  Harry knew that he had succeeded .  He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers , as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion .  “ I’m putting the Elder Wand , ” he told Dumbledore , who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration , “ back where it came from .  It can stay there .  If I die a natural death like Ignotus , its power will be broken , won’t it ?  The previous master will never have been defeated .  That’ll be the end of it . ”  Dumbledore nodded .  They smiled at each other .  “ Are you sure ? ”  said Ron .  There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand .  “ I think Harry’s right , ” said Hermione quietly .  “ That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth , ” said Harry .  “ Andquite honestly , ” he turned away from the painted portraits , thinking now only of the four poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower , and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there , “ I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime . ”

input text: ```
 Harry held up the Elder Wand , and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that , even in his befuddled and sleep deprived state , Harry did not like to see .  “ I don’t want it , ” said Harry .  “ What ? ”  said Ron loudly .  “ Are you mental ? ”  “ I know it’s powerful , ” said Harry wearily .  “ But I was happier with mine .  So ” He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck , and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather .  Hermione had said that they could not be repaired , that the damage was too severe .  All he knew was that if this did not work , nothing would .  He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk , touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand , and said , “ Reparo . ”  As his wand resealed , red sparks flew out of its end .  Harry knew that he had succeeded .  He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers , as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion .  “ I’m putting the Elder Wand , ” he told Dumbledore , who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration , “ back where it came from .  It can stay there .  If I die a natural death like Ignotus , its power will be broken , won’t it ?  The previous master will never have been defeated .  That’ll be the end of it . ”  Dumbledore nodded .  They smiled at each other .  “ Are you sure ? ”  said Ron .  There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand .  “ I think Harry’s right , ” said Hermione quietly .  “ That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth , ” said Harry .  “ Andquite honestly , ” he turned away from the painted portraits , thinking now only of the four poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower , and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there , “ I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime . ”
